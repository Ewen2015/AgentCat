# Enterprise Agent

The large language model (LLM) itself has limited value in the enterprise. The real value comes from

1. The ability to connect to enterprise data sources and knowledge bases. -- the context connection. 
2. The ability to connect to enterprise systems and take actions on behalf of users. -- the action connection.
3. An agent system that builds on the above as a foundation for building more intelligent systems.
